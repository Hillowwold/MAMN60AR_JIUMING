# MAMN60AR_JIUMING
This is Jiuming Zeng's code for MAMN60 AR course of LTH.
The code of AR marker detector is made according to Unity's official tutorial. I changed the object, deleted one button and added my own UI canvas. The link to the tutorial is https://learn.unity.com/project/create-a-marker-based-ar-app?uv=2021.3&courseId=638497f8edbc2a590c72596b.
The code of AR plane detector is made according to one online video, the link is https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zz4y1N7Vx/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=2736ed92a49d46e15e0697781ada1738. I basically followed the tutorial, but changed the size of the objects and the color of the displayed plane.
